This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Kotlin related to the `removeIf` function.  The `removeIf` function modifies the original collection directly, which might lead to unexpected side effects if the developer anticipates a new collection being returned. This behavior differs from some other programming languages where such functions usually return a new collection, leaving the original unchanged.  The solution shows how to create a copy to avoid modifying the original collection.
